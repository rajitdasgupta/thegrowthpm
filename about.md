Iâ€™m Rajit. I work at [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com) (an online education company) as a Product Manager on the Growth Team. Since 2013, when I was fresh out of college, I have been fortunate to learn and grow into a job that I love, and gets me excited everyday.

How? Iâ€™ve come to realize that here are 2 things in life that I will always be passionate about: **learning how people think** and **building things.** Unfortunately, I was not cut out for either a career in psychology or design. Thus, after my early career in Online Marketing, I found my calling in Product Management â€” a field that I didnâ€™t know existed when I graduated.

This blog is a personal commitment for reflection, and a record of the things I learn on the job and in life â€“ so that I never forget them. If it helps you in the process, Iâ€™ll be humbled.

If you have thoughts, musings, grievances, or memes about the content of these pages, please share them with me at rajit.dasgupta[at]gmail.com â€“ and we can continue the conversation. ðŸ™‚
